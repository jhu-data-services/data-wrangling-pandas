# Data Wrangling in Python: Introduction to the pandas library
This beginner-to-intermediate level workshop will introduce you to the pandas library, a popular Python library for data cleaning, data wrangling, and data analysis. Participants in this interactive class will use Jupyter Notebooks software and Python code to import, understand, and prepare a dataset for further analysis or visualization. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:  
- Identify and use the two primary data structures of the pandas library: Series and DataFrame  
- Implement functions from the pandas library to explore and analyze a dataset, including:  
	- Handling missing data  
	- Filtering and sorting data  
	- Grouping data  
	- Calculating basic summary statistics  
- Find documentation for the pandas library to troubleshoot errors and apply new functions to analyze a dataset     

Prerequisites: Participants should be familiar with basic programming concepts, including variable assignment, data types, function calls, and installing packages or libraries. Introductory experience in Python or R will be especially helpful for this workshop.
